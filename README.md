# Happy &pi; day!
This is my submission for the Grayson Pi Day context!
Running it is pretty simple, all you need to do is:
1. Install Python 3.8+ and Pip, making sure they're
   present in your `PATH` variable. You'll also need
   git.
   
2. Install Pipenv by running:
```commandline
pip install pipenv
```
4. Clone this repository:
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/NotTani/piday-flask
```
5. Next, install the required dependencies and start
the Pipenv shell.
```commandline
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```
6. Run the app!
```commandline
flask run
```
